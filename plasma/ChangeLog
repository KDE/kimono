* Fix the PlasmaScripting.Applet.Extender() method

2009-07-19  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Regenerate the C# sources for the KDE 4.3 release
* Add a PlasmaScripting.PopupApplet for writing PopupApplets in C#

2009-01-12  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Regenerate the Plasma C# sources from the current headers, and add the new
KDE 4.3 widgets.

2009-01-26  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Make PlasmaScripting.QGraphicsWidget inherit from IQGraphicsItem.

2009-01-12  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Add the Plasma.Service and Plasma.ServiceJob classes and regenerated the 
  sources from the current headers

2008-12-01  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Changed the tiger applet example to find its tiger.svg resource from within
  the plasmoid package.

2008-12-06  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Don't throw an Exception on compiler warnings
* Set CompilerOptions to an empty string so the nemerle compiler won't crash
* Add tiger-boo and tiger-nemerle examples that are compiled at runtime

2008-12-05  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Add support for compiling sources at runtime. Supported languages for now:
  C#, Boo, Nemerle, VB.NET (this one doesn't quite work yet - the compiler seems
  to be buggy).
  The first non-blank line in the mainscript file needs to be a comment in the form
  // language:csharp references:System.Xml sources:otherfile.cs
  'meta-comments' for different languages look equivalent. By default references for
  qt-dotnet, kde-dotnet and plasma-dll are added. The default language is C#, the
  default source file is only 'main'. So if a script is written in C#, only needs
  qt, kde and plasma bindings and all the code is contained in 'main', this comment
  can be omitted.
  For each source file a md5 hash is created so it's only recompiled if the source
  was modified.

2008-12-01  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added UpdateAllSources() and RemoveSource() slots to the 
  PlasmScripting.DataEngine
* Used reflection to call various protected methods in the underlying applet
  or dataEngine from the PlasmaScripting.Applet and PlasmaScripting.DataEngine
  classes

2008-11-28  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added a time data engine example
* Brought the Scripting Data Engine Init() method in line with the Applet code
* Added a Sources() method for the DataEngine to report a list of its sources
* Regenerated the Plasma classes from the current headers

2008-10-30  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Regenerate the sources with the renamed classes ConfigLoader, FlashingLabel
  IconWidget and WebView.
* TODO: The Applet.Extender() method is now protected and the ScriptApplet
  class needs to invoke it via reflection.

2008-10-21  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Regenerate the C# sources and add the new SvgWidget class
* Fix compile errors in the examples caused by the api changes

2008-09-22  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Regenerate the C# sources from the current plasma headers, add ScrollBar 
  and TreeView widgets
* Add the missing calendar.ui file to the clock example

2008-08-23  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Also check for referenced assemblies in the same path as the main assembly.

2008-08-12  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Sizes of applets are now correctly restored.
* debug--

2008-08-11  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Add the analog-clock applet converted to C#.

2008-08-10  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Add some missing classes.
* Fix ShowConfigurationDialog() for the ScriptEngine.

2008-08-09  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* If necessary, initialize additional bindings in the ScriptEngine.
* If the class with the name of the main assembly and in the namespace
  with the name of the parent directory is not found, look for classes that
  inherit from PlasmaScripting.Applet and choose the first one.

2008-08-05  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Add some new plasma classes Plasma::Frame, Plasma::PaintUtils, 
  Plasma::PopupApplet, Plasma::Slider, Plasma::TabBar and 
  Plasma::ToolTipManager

2008-07-08  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>
* Put the PlasmaScriptengineKimono.* classes all in one assembly.

2008-07-08  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added a marshaller for the Plasma::DataEngine::Data type so that 
  DateUpdated() slots should work
* Fixed overriden virtual methods in the Tiger applet so they work by addding
  the 'override' keyword to the declarations.

2008-07-07  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added a tiger example C# applet. It wasn't possible to build an executable
  called 'main' as mono gave an error about it not having an extension.
  Maybe some sort of special cmake macro is needed for building C# plasmoids.
* When looking for event handlers which have been overriden use the 
  BindingFlags.Declared option on GetMethod() to avoid picking up the
  inherited ones, which will always be there. TODO: The code should really
  look at all types in the heirachy for event handlers until it reaches the
  PlasmaScripting.Applet type.

2008-07-06  Arno Rehn  <arno@arnorehn.de>

	* Moved the PlasmaScripting.* classes back into the main plasma assembly,
	  since we can't reference Applet.dll and DataEngine.dll for C# Plasma
	  plugins.

2008-07-06  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Add a PlasmaScripting.QGraphicsWidget class with all the public methods in
  the QGraphicsWidget/QGraphicsItem/QGraphicsLayoutItem heirarchy implemented
  by forwarding the calls to the underlying Plasma.Applet.
* Implemented event handling method overrides via an event filter in the
  Applet ScriptEngine
* Added a .desktop file for the DataEngine script engine
* The Plasma sources have been regenerated with tabs replaced with spaces.
  The methods on the Plasma.DataEngineScripting class special cased so that
  they are public otherwise it wasn't very convenient for this particular
  implementation of a scripting data engine.

2008-07-02  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added a PlasmaScripting.DataEngine class, which will be part of the main
  plasma .dll, and two classes 'KimonoAppletScript.DataEngine' and 
  'KimonoAppletScript.Applet' for implementing the ScriptEngine plugins for 
  Applets and DataEngines

2008-07-02  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added a PlasmaScripting.Applet class which will be subclassed to implement
  ScriptEngine based C# plasmoids. The Plasma.Applet source was copied and
  enums and static methods were removed. The code in the public methods was
  changed to forward the method call to the underlying applet. To do this for
  the protected methods, reflection will need to be used.
* Added an implicit type conversion operator so that a PlasmaScripting.Applet
  can be used in the Plasma api everywhere a Plasma.Applet would be expected.
