	* Use QByteArrays in the kimonpluginfactory, rather than QStrings to 
	  simplify the code

	* KimonoPluginFactory: If a class isn't found in the assembly, look
	  through all of the classes and pick the first one that implements
	  the interface and has a matching constructor.
	* Allow to call InitRuntime() multiple times to make sure that every
	  binding is initialized.

	* mono_jit_cleanup() is now called from a function that is registered
	  via atexit(). This seems to be the only way to do that, since calling
	  it from the destructor of KimonoPluginFactory makes mono crash.
	* Added camelize() method from krubypluginfactory.
	* Added "KSharedPtr<KSharedConfig>" to the marshallers array.

	* Added KMonoPluginFactory. Behaves similar to KRubyPluginFactory:
		* If the keyword is Foo/Bar.dll, a class 'Bar' is searched in the
		  namespace 'Foo'.
		* This class has to have a constructor that takes a QObject (the
		  parent) and a List<QVariant> (the arguments).

	* Make both the smoke lib and the kimono bindings use non-const methods
	  in preference to const ones. This is because KConfigBase::group() 
	  behaves differently according to whether the const on non-const
	  version is called via overloading in C++. The non-const variant
	  will now be called in C#, otherwise it appears that the KConfigGroup 
	  returned would silently fail to write anything to disc.

	* Change some namespaces to classes as calling the methods via 'Global'
	  looked a bit clumsy. For instance, KConfig.Global.Config() or
	  KStandardAction.Global.Quit() looked wrong.
	* Add a KSharedConfigPtr marshaller

	* Prefer const methods over non-const methods.

2008-06-18  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>

* Added tutorial examples p3 and p4. p4 crashes on a call to 
  KHTMLPart.Widget(), which could be a problem with modular smoke
  either method lookup or return value marshalling.
* Don't convert QChars to C# chars, keep them as QChars
* Added the name of the current Assembly as the first entry in the args
  array passed to KCmdLineArgs.Init().
* Added the p7 tutorial. There is a problem with this line:

    KConfig config = KApplication.kApplication().SessionConfig();
    location.Text = 
      config.Group("Settings").ReadEntry("defaultPage", "http://localhost");

  The Group() method isn't found in the smoke lib

* Added marshallers for the various types of lists in the KDE classes
* Special case the Init() methods in KCmdLineArgs to take string[] args,
  for the C++ 'int, char[] *' pairs.
